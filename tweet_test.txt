Does Modi Govt comprehend that #KeralaFlood has left 357 have died, 4 lakh are in shelter homes, 30,000 houses destroyed & 16,000 Kms of roads damaged.

Why is Modiji not declaring #KeralaFlood a ‘National Calamity’?Stop punishing flood ravaged Kerala.

Kerala, a beautiful, progressive & literate coastal state in India, is facing worst flood in 100 years. 100s have died, 320,000 are in 2000 camps. No power/food for 1000s waiting to be evacuated.
