Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !

A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.

PM @narendramodi expressed grief and sorrow on the unfortunate deaths and damage caused to property due to floods in Kerala. PM announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh per person to the next kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to those seriously injured from PMNRF.

This move from the Central Govt. will close the doors of South India for @BJP4India permanently. Kerala floods caused damage worth more than ‚Çπ 20000 crores & @narendramodi Govt. able to manage relief activities with its ‚Çπ 500 crores!

Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !

A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.

Kerala Floods: Send choppers or pick up dead bodies tomorrow, Chengannur MLA Saji Cherian tells Centre.

True, thats why communists are dead everywhere except Kerala. After this disastrous flood in Kerala hopefully Keralites will wake up and cremate commies and immerse the ashes in arabian sea.

Kerala flood leaves 324 dead. 3,14,391  homeless, 2,094 in relief camps. 100,000 rescued . Modi doles out Rs.500 cr (versus 20000 cr request).That is enough for Kerala!! Kumbh Mela allotted 5000cr. Shivaji & Patel statues 3500cr each!! @MGNTheTwin @inquestioner @CarDroidusMax

532 villages damaged by floods; many dead,thousands displaced.

Pray for ChoG Kerala (India) as unprecedented rain has resulted in devastating floods and landslides. Some in our ChoG family among 230,000 flood refugees; we have church buildings submerged; 324 Indians known dead so far; large swaths of Cochin underwater. #PrayerMatters

The floods in Southern India‚Äôs Kerala state are absolutely devastating. 350 dead and 800,000 displaced. It is a terrible humanitarian disaster. My thoughts are with all my Indian Australian friends and those particularly who have family in Kerala. 

The same people who are demanding that the Kerala Floods be declared a national disaster  made no such demand for the Gujarat earthquake ( 20,000 dead) or for the Uttaranchal floods (almost 9500 dead) 

Indian PM announces $75M financial aid to flood-ravaged Kerala state on Sat; 324 confirmed dead in Kerala in what is said to be the southern state's worst monsoon in almost a century. #KeralaFloods

Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !

A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.

Yesterday watched #discoverychannel program #keralaflood .
Very much sad to see that it didn't documented #RSS volunteers work.
But instead it shows a church as religious body worked in flood, infact churches contribute nothing in kerelaflood.

All prayers for the People of Kerala India. More than 300 people dead due to the floods and post flood situation.

1000 or more dead in India floods. 200,000 made homeless in Kerala and #BBC news led on vaping. Insane

The worst floods in a century have inundated the state of #Kerala in #India. More than 300 dead. Help the 300,000+ now stranded in camps make it through this calamity.

It is official. When it comes to the right wing sympathizers bigotry and whataboutery is alive and kicking and humanity is dead. Case in point is some of messages that are being put out equating the sabarimala issue with the floods.  Be strong Kerala majority of India is with you

India's Kerala floods:

The ravages of the flood this monsoon didn't just uproot life in Kerala, it also severely affected Kodagu (Coorg) in Karnataka, leaving 20 people dead.

My heart goes out to those in Kerala who are weathering the worst floods in centuries: hundreds of thousands of homeless and hundreds dead. Deepest gratitude to the military as well as to the fishermen who are using their own boats for courageous rescues.
