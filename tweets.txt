Does Modi Govt comprehend that #KeralaFlood has left 357 have died, 4 lakh are in shelter homes, 30,000 houses destroyed & 16,000 Kms of roads damaged.

Why is Modiji not declaring #KeralaFlood a ‚ÄòNational Calamity‚Äô?Stop punishing flood ravaged Kerala.

This is terrible. Twenty five people have died in rain related incidents in Kerala today. Total death toll since August 7th stands at 67. Pinarayi Vijayan asks people to co-operate and move to relief camps if asked. #KeralaFlood


Kerala pulls of the near impossible - 22,000 saved from danger in the biggest flood in 100 years. Done with the crucial rescue phase, now onto the daunting job of relief, rehabilitation & rebuild. #WeShallOvercome #KeralaFloodRelief


PM @narendramodi expressed grief and sorrow on the unfortunate deaths and damage caused to property due to floods in Kerala. PM announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh per person to the next kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to those seriously injured from PMNRF.

Kerala, God‚Äôs own country, is going through one of the most traumatic & devastating natural calamities ever with the floods wreaking havoc, destroying, ruining, ransacking & demolishing & razing everything flat.They need our support & unity in building & bringing back the beauty

The Kerala flood situation was discussed as a priority in the National Convention of the Nationalist Congress Party. According to the government's statistics, the total damage caused due to this flood is Rs. 19,964 crore 68 lakh.

The UAE the country has pledged ‚Çπ700 crore for flood-battered Kerala for building ‚ÄúNew Kerala‚Äù. It is unfortunate that our own Central Govt headed by Narendra Modiji failed to open the purse,only ‚Çπ500 crore allocated from SDRF! Why not adding from NDRF?

This move from the Central Govt. will close the doors of South India for @BJP4India permanently. Kerala floods caused damage worth more than ‚Çπ 20000 crores & @narendramodi Govt. able to manage relief activities with its ‚Çπ 500 crores!

Sunny Leone donated Rs. 5 crore to Kerala flood victims. 
On the other hand, actresses who scream nationalism at the top of their lungs on Twitter are busy in building stage for their political career.

Cost to rebuild ‚Çπ 19,512 crore. 223 people have died. 10.78 lakh People displaced. Crops over 40,000 hectares lost. 26,000+ houses damaged. Roads along 16,000 km damaged.


Kerala, is facing its worst flood in 100yrs. 324 lives lost & 7,24,649 people are staying in 2,971 relief camps. 10000 houses have been washed away & 26,000+ damaged. Plz help us to rebuild. Donate to

Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !


A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.


Yesterday watched #discoverychannel program #keralaflood .
Very much sad to see that it didn't documented #RSS volunteers work.
But instead it shows a church as religious body worked in flood, infact churches contribute nothing in kerelaflood.

It is official. When it comes to the right wing sympathizers bigotry and whataboutery is alive and kicking and humanity is dead. Case in point is some of messages that are being put out equating the sabarimala issue with the floods.  Be strong Kerala majority of India is with you

More than 300 people are dead or missing in Kerala floods. Indian Army and NDRF jawans doing their best in rescue mission. Hope my near and dear ones are safe. Praying to Mahadev for the safety of Kerala people.


Kerala is going through worst flood situation.

The ravages of the flood this monsoon didn't just uproot life in Kerala, it also severely affected Kodagu (Coorg) in Karnataka, leaving 20 people dead.


My heart goes out to those in Kerala who are weathering the worst floods in centuries: hundreds of thousands of homeless and hundreds dead. Deepest gratitude to the military as well as to the fishermen who are using their own boats for courageous rescues. 


817 people dead on account of floods and heavy rains this monsoon.
Kerala -- 247 dead so far 
UP -- 191
West Bengal-- 183
Maharashtra-- 140
Assam -- 45 &

Of these Kerala is experiencing the worst ever flood in the last 100 years. Join hands to DONATE üôèüèª

Kerala Floods: Send choppers or pick up dead bodies tomorrow, Chengannur MLA Saji Cherian tells Centre.


True, thats why communists are dead everywhere except Kerala. After this disastrous flood in Kerala hopefully Keralites will wake up and cremate commies and immerse the ashes in arabian sea.


Kerala flood leaves 324 dead. 3,14,391  homeless, 2,094 in relief camps. 100,000 rescued . Modi doles out Rs.500 cr (versus 20000 cr request).That is enough for Kerala!! Kumbh Mela allotted 5000cr. Shivaji & Patel statues 3500cr each!! @MGNTheTwin @inquestioner @CarDroidusMax


532 villages damaged by floods; many dead,thousands displaced.
Let us again show d same luv nd concern for our North-East brothers nd sisters dat we showed for our beloved Kerala

Pray for ChoG Kerala (India) as unprecedented rain has resulted in devastating floods and landslides. Some in our ChoG family among 230,000 flood refugees; we have church buildings submerged; 324 Indians known dead so far; large swaths of Cochin underwater. #PrayerMatters


The floods in Southern India‚Äôs Kerala state are absolutely devastating. 350 dead and 800,000 displaced. It is a terrible humanitarian disaster. My thoughts are with all my Indian Australian friends and those particularly who have family in Kerala. 


The same people who are demanding that the Kerala Floods be declared a national disaster  made no such demand for the Gujarat earthquake ( 20,000 dead) or for the Uttaranchal floods (almost 9500 dead)

This is terrible. Twenty five people have died in rain related incidents in Kerala today. Total death toll since August 7th stands at 67. Pinarayi Vijayan asks people to co-operate and move to relief camps if asked. #KeralaFlood


Kerala pulls of the near impossible - 22,000 saved from danger in the biggest flood in 100 years. Done with the crucial rescue phase, now onto the daunting job of relief, rehabilitation & rebuild. #WeShallOvercome #KeralaFloodRelief


PM @narendramodi expressed grief and sorrow on the unfortunate deaths and damage caused to property due to floods in Kerala. PM announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh per person to the next kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to those seriously injured from PMNRF.

Kerala, God‚Äôs own country, is going through one of the most traumatic & devastating natural calamities ever with the floods wreaking havoc, destroying, ruining, ransacking & demolishing & razing everything flat.They need our support & unity in building & bringing back the beauty

The Kerala flood situation was discussed as a priority in the National Convention of the Nationalist Congress Party. According to the government's statistics, the total damage caused due to this flood is Rs. 19,964 crore 68 lakh.

The UAE the country has pledged ‚Çπ700 crore for flood-battered Kerala for building ‚ÄúNew Kerala‚Äù. It is unfortunate that our own Central Govt headed by Narendra Modiji failed to open the purse,only ‚Çπ500 crore allocated from SDRF! Why not adding from NDRF?

This move from the Central Govt. will close the doors of South India for @BJP4India permanently. Kerala floods caused damage worth more than ‚Çπ 20000 crores & @narendramodi Govt. able to manage relief activities with its ‚Çπ 500 crores!

Sunny Leone donated Rs. 5 crore to Kerala flood victims. 
On the other hand, actresses who scream nationalism at the top of their lungs on Twitter are busy in building stage for their political career.

Cost to rebuild ‚Çπ 19,512 crore. 223 people have died. 10.78 lakh People displaced. Crops over 40,000 hectares lost. 26,000+ houses damaged. Roads along 16,000 km damaged.


Kerala, is facing its worst flood in 100yrs. 324 lives lost & 7,24,649 people are staying in 2,971 relief camps. 10000 houses have been washed away & 26,000+ damaged. Plz help us to rebuild. Donate to

This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !


A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.


Yesterday watched #discoverychannel program #keralaflood .
Very much sad to see that it didn't documented #RSS volunteers work.
But instead it shows a church as religious body worked in flood, infact churches contribute nothing in kerelaflood.


People Call her BITCH

Sunny Leone donated 5 Crore for Kerala Flood


All prayers for the People of Kerala India. More than 300 people dead due to the floods and post flood situation.

The worst floods in a century have inundated the state of #Kerala in #India. More than 300 dead. Help the 300,000+ now stranded in camps make it through this calamity.


It is official. When it comes to the right wing sympathizers bigotry and whataboutery is alive and kicking and humanity is dead. Case in point is some of messages that are being put out equating the sabarimala issue with the floods.  Be strong Kerala majority of India is with you


India's Kerala floods:
- At least 370 dead
-  800,000 displaced

The ravages of the flood this monsoon didn't just uproot life in Kerala, it also severely affected Kodagu (Coorg) in Karnataka, leaving 20 people dead.


My heart goes out to those in Kerala who are weathering the worst floods in centuries: hundreds of thousands of homeless and hundreds dead. Deepest gratitude to the military as well as to the fishermen who are using their own boats for courageous rescues.

The floods in Southern India‚Äôs Kerala state are absolutely devastating. 350 dead and 800,000 displaced. It is a terrible humanitarian disaster. My thoughts are with all my Indian Australian friends and those particularly who have family in Kerala. 


The same people who are demanding that the Kerala Floods be declared a national disaster  made no such demand for the Gujarat earthquake ( 20,000 dead) or for the Uttaranchal floods (almost 9500 dead)

Kerala pulls of the near impossible - 22,000 saved from danger in the biggest flood in 100 years. Done with the crucial rescue phase, now onto the daunting job of relief, rehabilitation & rebuild. #WeShallOvercome #KeralaFloodRelief


PM @narendramodi expressed grief and sorrow on the unfortunate deaths and damage caused to property due to floods in Kerala. PM announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh per person to the next kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to those seriously injured from PMNRF.

Kerala, God‚Äôs own country, is going through one of the most traumatic & devastating natural calamities ever with the floods wreaking havoc, destroying, ruining, ransacking & demolishing & razing everything flat.They need our support & unity in building & bringing back the beauty

The Kerala flood situation was discussed as a priority in the National Convention of the Nationalist Congress Party. According to the government's statistics, the total damage caused due to this flood is Rs. 19,964 crore 68 lakh.

The UAE the country has pledged ‚Çπ700 crore for flood-battered Kerala for building ‚ÄúNew Kerala‚Äù. It is unfortunate that our own Central Govt headed by Narendra Modiji failed to open the purse,only ‚Çπ500 crore allocated from SDRF! Why not adding from NDRF?

This move from the Central Govt. will close the doors of South India for @BJP4India permanently. Kerala floods caused damage worth more than ‚Çπ 20000 crores & @narendramodi Govt. able to manage relief activities with its ‚Çπ 500 crores!

Sunny Leone donated Rs. 5 crore to Kerala flood victims. 
On the other hand, actresses who scream nationalism at the top of their lungs on Twitter are busy in building stage for their political career.

Cost to rebuild ‚Çπ 19,512 crore. 223 people have died. 10.78 lakh People displaced. Crops over 40,000 hectares lost. 26,000+ houses damaged. Roads along 16,000 km damaged.


Kerala, is facing its worst flood in 100yrs. 324 lives lost & 7,24,649 people are staying in 2,971 relief camps. 10000 houses have been washed away & 26,000+ damaged. Plz help us to rebuild. Donate to

Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !


A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.


Yesterday watched #discoverychannel program #keralaflood .
Very much sad to see that it didn't documented #RSS volunteers work.
But instead it shows a church as religious body worked in flood, infact churches contribute nothing in kerelaflood.

It is official. When it comes to the right wing sympathizers bigotry and whataboutery is alive and kicking and humanity is dead. Case in point is some of messages that are being put out equating the sabarimala issue with the floods.  Be strong Kerala majority of India is with you


India's Kerala floods:

My heart goes out to those in Kerala who are weathering the worst floods in centuries: hundreds of thousands of homeless and hundreds dead. Deepest gratitude to the military as well as to the fishermen who are using their own boats for courageous rescues.

PM @narendramodi expressed grief and sorrow on the unfortunate deaths and damage caused to property due to floods in Kerala. PM announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh per person to the next kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to those seriously injured from PMNRF.

Kerala, God‚Äôs own country, is going through one of the most traumatic & devastating natural calamities ever with the floods wreaking havoc, destroying, ruining, ransacking & demolishing & razing everything flat.They need our support & unity in building & bringing back the beauty

The Kerala flood situation was discussed as a priority in the National Convention of the Nationalist Congress Party. According to the government's statistics, the total damage caused due to this flood is Rs. 19,964 crore 68 lakh.

The UAE the country has pledged ‚Çπ700 crore for flood-battered Kerala for building ‚ÄúNew Kerala‚Äù. It is unfortunate that our own Central Govt headed by Narendra Modiji failed to open the purse,only ‚Çπ500 crore allocated from SDRF! Why not adding from NDRF?

This move from the Central Govt. will close the doors of South India for @BJP4India permanently. Kerala floods caused damage worth more than ‚Çπ 20000 crores & @narendramodi Govt. able to manage relief activities with its ‚Çπ 500 crores!

Sunny Leone donated Rs. 5 crore to Kerala flood victims. 
On the other hand, actresses who scream nationalism at the top of their lungs on Twitter are busy in building stage for their political career.

Cost to rebuild ‚Çπ 19,512 crore. 223 people have died. 10.78 lakh People displaced. Crops over 40,000 hectares lost. 26,000+ houses damaged. Roads along 16,000 km damaged.


Kerala, is facing its worst flood in 100yrs. 324 lives lost & 7,24,649 people are staying in 2,971 relief camps. 10000 houses have been washed away & 26,000+ damaged. Plz help us to rebuild. Donate to

Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !


A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.


Yesterday watched #discoverychannel program #keralaflood .
Very much sad to see that it didn't documented #RSS volunteers work.
But instead it shows a church as religious body worked in flood, infact churches contribute nothing in kerelaflood.


People Call her BITCH

All prayers for the People of Kerala India. More than 300 people dead due to the floods and post flood situation.


1000 or more dead in India floods. 200,000 made homeless in Kerala and #BBC news led on vaping. Insane


The worst floods in a century have inundated the state of #Kerala in #India. More than 300 dead. Help the 300,000+ now stranded in camps make it through this calamity.


It is official. When it comes to the right wing sympathizers bigotry and whataboutery is alive and kicking and humanity is dead. Case in point is some of messages that are being put out equating the sabarimala issue with the floods.  Be strong Kerala majority of India is with you


India's Kerala floods:
- At least 370 dead
-  800,000 displaced
-  $3bn in damage 
- 'Worst flood in a century' 


Nearly 400 people are confirmed dead in India‚Äôs southern state of Kerala after its worst flood in a century.
80,000 people can't return home and officials are worried about disease spreading in relief camps. 


More than 300 people are dead or missing in Kerala floods. Indian Army and NDRF jawans doing their best in rescue mission. Hope my near and dear ones are safe. Praying to Mahadev for the safety of Kerala people.

My home state of Kerala, India before & after the devastating floods. It's a humanitarian crisis. 80% of the state affected, hundreds dead, 200,000+ homeless.

'Rat fever' cases rise after Kerala floods, 12 dead since August 1


800,000 displaced, more than 350 dead in torrential downpour in southern India's Kerala state. Weeks of relentless rains have triggered floods and landslides, and caused homes and bridges to collapse. 


Kerala has been hit by the worst floods in a century, they have left over 300 dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. 
Our quick response will provide food and essentials such as hygiene products to over 32,000 people.

Please pray for Kerala India today! Hundreds are dead. Hundreds of thousands are displaced after horrific floods & landslides have devastated Kerala. PLEASE take time to share.


The ravages of the flood this monsoon didn't just uproot life in Kerala, it also severely affected Kodagu (Coorg) in Karnataka, leaving 20 people dead.


My heart goes out to those in Kerala who are weathering the worst floods in centuries: hundreds of thousands of homeless and hundreds dead. Deepest gratitude to the military as well as to the fishermen who are using their own boats for courageous rescues.

Kerala -- 247 dead so far 
UP -- 191
West Bengal-- 183

Kerala Floods: Send choppers or pick up dead bodies tomorrow, Chengannur MLA Saji Cherian tells Centre.


True, thats why communists are dead everywhere except Kerala. After this disastrous flood in Kerala hopefully Keralites will wake up and cremate commies and immerse the ashes in arabian sea.


Kerala flood leaves 324 dead. 3,14,391  homeless, 2,094 in relief camps. 100,000 rescued . Modi doles out Rs.500 cr (versus 20000 cr request).That is enough for Kerala!! Kumbh Mela allotted 5000cr. Shivaji & Patel statues 3500cr each!! @MGNTheTwin @inquestioner @CarDroidusMax

The floods in Southern India‚Äôs Kerala state are absolutely devastating. 350 dead and 800,000 displaced. It is a terrible humanitarian disaster. My thoughts are with all my Indian Australian friends and those particularly who have family in Kerala. 


The same people who are demanding that the Kerala Floods be declared a national disaster  made no such demand for the Gujarat earthquake ( 20,000 dead) or for the Uttaranchal floods (almost 9500 dead)
