Does Modi Govt comprehend that #KeralaFlood has left 357 have died, 4 lakh are in shelter homes, 30,000 houses destroyed & 16,000 Kms of roads damaged.

Why is Modiji not declaring #KeralaFlood a ‚ÄòNational Calamity‚Äô?Stop punishing flood ravaged Kerala.

Heavy rainfall continuing, 45 dead & counting, 33 of 39 dams opened, Idukki brimming at 2398 ft (capacity 2403), further threatened by sluice gates opened at Mullaperiyar (142 ft); red alert in all 14 districts - #KeralaFlood is unprecedented


This is terrible. Twenty five people have died in rain related incidents in Kerala today. Total death toll since August 7th stands at 67. Pinarayi Vijayan asks people to co-operate and move to relief camps if asked. #KeralaFlood


Kerala pulls of the near impossible - 22,000 saved from danger in the biggest flood in 100 years. Done with the crucial rescue phase, now onto the daunting job of relief, rehabilitation & rebuild. #WeShallOvercome #KeralaFloodRelief


PM @narendramodi expressed grief and sorrow on the unfortunate deaths and damage caused to property due to floods in Kerala. PM announced ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh per person to the next kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to those seriously injured from PMNRF.

Kerala, God‚Äôs own country, is going through one of the most traumatic & devastating natural calamities ever with the floods wreaking havoc, destroying, ruining, ransacking & demolishing & razing everything flat.They need our support & unity in building & bringing back the beauty

The Kerala flood situation was discussed as a priority in the National Convention of the Nationalist Congress Party. According to the government's statistics, the total damage caused due to this flood is Rs. 19,964 crore 68 lakh.

The UAE the country has pledged ‚Çπ700 crore for flood-battered Kerala for building ‚ÄúNew Kerala‚Äù. It is unfortunate that our own Central Govt headed by Narendra Modiji failed to open the purse,only ‚Çπ500 crore allocated from SDRF! Why not adding from NDRF?

This move from the Central Govt. will close the doors of South India for @BJP4India permanently. Kerala floods caused damage worth more than ‚Çπ 20000 crores & @narendramodi Govt. able to manage relief activities with its ‚Çπ 500 crores!

Sunny Leone donated Rs. 5 crore to Kerala flood victims. 
On the other hand, actresses who scream nationalism at the top of their lungs on Twitter are busy in building stage for their political career.

Cost to rebuild ‚Çπ 19,512 crore. 223 people have died. 10.78 lakh People displaced. Crops over 40,000 hectares lost. 26,000+ houses damaged. Roads along 16,000 km damaged.


Kerala, is facing its worst flood in 100yrs. 324 lives lost & 7,24,649 people are staying in 2,971 relief camps. 10000 houses have been washed away & 26,000+ damaged. Plz help us to rebuild. Donate to

Yes, true Modi gave only 500cr for rehabilation to Kerala after devastating flood.
This proves Modi is just not insensitive but also not at all a patriot. He can built a statue of 3000cr but don't want to help Kerala state after flood.
Proves RSS+BJP+Modi govt are anti people !


A 3000-cr statue in one of the most backward districts of Gujarat is a farce. We are not against Patel,
but we want schools and hospitals- said tribal leader Praful Vasava.
Despite 19,500 Crs loss in Kerala Flood, Modiji provided only 500 Crore relief.


Yesterday watched #discoverychannel program #keralaflood .
Very much sad to see that it didn't documented #RSS volunteers work.
But instead it shows a church as religious body worked in flood, infact churches contribute nothing in kerelaflood.
